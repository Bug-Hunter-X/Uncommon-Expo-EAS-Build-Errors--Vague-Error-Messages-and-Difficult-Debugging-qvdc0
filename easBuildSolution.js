Debugging these types of vague errors requires a systematic approach:

1. **Thoroughly Examine Build Logs:** The complete output of the failed `eas build` command is crucial.  Search carefully for any error messages that might hint at the root cause.  Don't just focus on the initial, top-level error message.

2. **Simplify and Isolate:** If possible, create a minimal reproducible example by stripping down your app to its essential components. This helps determine if a specific dependency or feature is causing the issue.

3. **Dependency Review:** Check your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. Make sure all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure a clean installation of dependencies.

4. **Environment Check (Android):**
    * Verify that the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured.  Check the ANDROID_HOME environment variable.
    * Ensure that the necessary build tools are available and up-to-date.
    * Consider cleaning the Android build cache: `./gradlew clean`

5. **Environment Check (iOS):**
    * Make sure Xcode and the necessary iOS development tools are correctly installed and configured.
    * Clean the Xcode project and try building again.

6. **Expo Prebuild:** Run `expo prebuild` before `eas build` to identify any potential issues early on.

7. **Community Support:** Consult the Expo forums, documentation, and community resources for similar issues.  Providing detailed build logs increases your chances of getting assistance.

8. **Native Module Debugging (Advanced):** If the issue involves native modules, you might have to dive into the native code to debug the problem. This requires familiarity with Android (Java/Kotlin) or iOS (Swift/Objective-C) development.
